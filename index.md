Facebook Libra is misrepresented, unnecessary, and dangerous.

This website serves to help everyone understand why that’s the case. Click here to jump straight to it.

We intend to maintain a valuable resource here but make no claim to being definitive. We also curate the broad and deep analysis, news and commentary on this topic at LibreNotLibra.com.

Please let us know @LibreNotLibra if you’d like to help us develop more detailed, specialist information in the context of government, economics, banking, decentralization, and privacy.

Facebook representatives are welcome to get in touch — it would be our pleasure to record a live interview with you. Please tweet @LibreNotLibra to set this up.

## How does Facebook describe its Libra project?
Retrieved from https://libra.org/en-US/vision/#how_it_works at 15:00 UTC, 3rd July 2019:

> ### The Vision
> Libra is a global, digitally native, reserve-backed cryptocurrency built on the foundation of blockchain technology. People will be able to send, receive, spend, and secure their money, enabling a more inclusive global financial system.
>
> ### The Currency
> The unit of currency is called Libra. The aim is to make Libra as widely accepted and as easy to use as possible to create a currency that people can use with confidence and convenience in their everyday lives.
>
> ### The Reserve
> Unlike the majority of cryptocurrencies, Libra is fully backed by a reserve of real assets. A basket of currencies and assets will be held in the Libra Reserve for every Libra that is created, building trust in its intrinsic value.
>
> ### The Blockchain
> The Libra Blockchain is operated by a network of validator nodes. The evolution of the blockchain will be overseen by the Founding Members of the Libra Association, and each member will be responsible for running a validator node. As the network grows and becomes more self-sustaining, the Libra Association will work to gradually transition to a permissionless mode of operation.
